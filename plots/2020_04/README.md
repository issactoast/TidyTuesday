**Note:** This was a fun project with the focus on designing an infographic, not on data scraping and statistical analysis. The data set does not contain all rappers and especially some with high values of unique words (big up Aesop!) are missing. Further, some popularity ratings are based on a very small sample size. Notably, the correlation of popularity with # unique words and danceability is very weak and a fun outcome without any data support currently.
